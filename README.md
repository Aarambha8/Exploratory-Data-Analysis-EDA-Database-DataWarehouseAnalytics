# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Database-DataWarehouseAnalytics
Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a Data Warehouse built using a Star Schema. The analysis uses curated Gold-layer fact and dimension tables to evaluate sales performance, customer behavior, and product contribution.

The goal of this EDA is to validate the data model, understand business patterns, and generate decision-ready insights before moving into dashboarding or advanced analytics.

**🏗️ Data Model Summary**

The analysis is conducted on:

Fact Table: Sales transactions capturing revenue, quantity, pricing, and order dates

Dimension Tables: Customer and product attributes such as demographics, geography, category, and product details

This structure reflects industry-standard dimensional modeling, enabling scalable reporting and consistent KPIs.
